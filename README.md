🚀 My Personal Project with Spring Boot
=======================================

This project is a **long-term software-as-a-service (SaaS)** application that I'm developing. While working on it, I take the opportunity to learn new and crucial technologies, including **Spring Boot**, to build an **API** connected to a **MySQL** database. The goal is to create a robust, scalable application capable of efficiently managing data.

### 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a **SaaS application** using **Spring Boot** for the API and MySQL for data storage. While this is a long-term project, it also allows me to learn and apply modern technologies such as **Spring Boot**, **JPA**, and **Hibernate**.

### 🔧 Current Features

At this stage, the API manages two **simple tables** in the database. These tables are used to store specific information for my project (which I am not disclosing at this time). Here's an overview of the features implemented so far:

*   **Complete CRUD**: Create, read, update, and delete entities through the API.

*   **GET by ID**: Retrieve a specific entity based on its ID.


### 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Spring Boot**: For building the RESTful API.

*   **MySQL**: Relational database for data storage.

*   **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For managing data persistence.

*   **Hibernate**: Used as the JPA implementation for managing entities.


### 🗄️ Database Structure

Currently, the project contains **two simple tables** used for storing information. The entities are related via foreign keys and are managed in a relational manner.

### 📚 What I Have Learned

*   Building and managing a **Spring Boot API** with **RESTful endpoints**.

*   Connecting to a **MySQL database** and using **JPA/Hibernate** to manage entities.

*   Implementing **CRUD** operations to interact with stored data.

*   Handling HTTP requests with **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, and using **Spring annotations**.


### 🚀 Next Steps

The next steps for this project include:

*   Starting the **front-end development** by creating a simple interface with a new technology (likely **Angular**).

*   Adding additional features to the API.

*   Improving scalability and performance.
